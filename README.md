# Twitter Scrapping Project

Objective: 

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in data scraping from social media platforms, and Twitter is one of the most widely used social media platforms that allow users to share their thoughts, opinions, news, and information with their followers in real-time via short messages called tweets.

Our project involves scraping tweets and their attributes based on certain user-defined parameters such as keywords, start date, end date, and the maximum number of tweets to display. We then process the scraped data and store it in a MongoDB database server. Additionally, we provide users with the option to download the scraped data in either CSV or JSON formats for their future reference and analysis.

By using this project, we can gain valuable insights into various aspects of the Twitter platform, such as user behavior, trending topics, and sentiment analysis. It also allows us to analyze the data using various statistical and machine learning tools to draw meaningful conclusions and insights.
